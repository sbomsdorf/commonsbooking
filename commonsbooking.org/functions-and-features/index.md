##  Application areas

The WordPress plugin was originally developed for the needs of the “ [ free
cargo bike ](http://dein-lastenrad.de) ” movement, but it can be used for the
rental of any items.

  * You/your organization has tools that are not used on a daily basis and you want to make them available to local groups. 
  * You own a cargo bike and want to share it with the community, it should be stationed at different locations throughout the year.
